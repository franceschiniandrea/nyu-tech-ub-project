## üîó Design Notes

- All `orderbook_` and `trade_` tables are symbol-specific and created dynamically.
- Currency metadata is periodically snapshotted and compared to detect changes.
- JSONB is used for fields that vary by network or have nested structure.
- Normalized symbols use format: `BASE/QUOTE:SETTLE` ‚Üí `btc_usdt`, `eth_usdc:usdc`.
